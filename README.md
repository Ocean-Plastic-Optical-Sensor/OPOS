#Overview
**Goal** : We want to 1. Locate, 2. Qualify, 3. Quantify plastic debris in the Ocean using Optics and Machine Learning.<br>

**Method** : Experimental. We design, build, test and share our experiments. <br>
Originally documented here : http://instructables.com/id/Remote-Controlled-Optical-Plastic-Sensor/ <br>
We are now migrating the content of our instructables on GitHub so everyone who wants to contribute can easily do so. The Repository will have the original files such as 
- Photos & videos of the sensor
- Specifications
- Original & Processed Video produced by the sensor
- Technical drawing
- Part List, with price and supplier
- 3D designs (sketchup and STL files)
- Wiring diagram, Eagle if produced
- Firmware
- Software
